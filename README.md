# GuessDaMate

GuessDaMate is a browser based two player game similar to the board game Guess Who. 

Users can sign up using a Google account and add friends by e-mail. They then chose from a topic and select 12 cards to play with. When the game begins each player is assigned a secret card at random and players take turns asking yes or no questions to try to guess the opponent's card.

## About
The project was inspired a gift a friend made for her friend - a physical recreation of Guess Who using pictures of their friends.

My next goal with the project is to integrate it with social media so users can play with a set of cards made up of their mutual friends.
